An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature’s training and competence in activities related to that ability. A score of 5 is the typical human average, but wastelanders and many creatures are a cut above average in most abilities. Characters can have scores as high as 10, and monsters can have scores as high as 20. Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from −4 (for an ability score of 1) to +5 (for a score of 10).

The GM calls for a skill check when a creature attempts to do something that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results. For every skill check, the GM decides which skill is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class (DC). The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the skill check is a success—the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it’s a failure, which means the creature makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the GM. Note: For GM’s, A good indicator on whether or not you should have a character roll a skill check is to ask yourself; “Is there at least a 20% chance of failure?” If so, then have a character roll with the DC being “very easy”. Anything below this is extremely monotonous to roll for and can make the characters feel like they aren’t good at anything if they continuously fail. Better to let them automatically succeed at anything that falls below the “20% line”. However;“Extremely small chance of failure” is the only exception, use this sparingly.",

Your Group Sneak is equal to each player character\u2019s Sneak modifier divided by the number of player characters.
