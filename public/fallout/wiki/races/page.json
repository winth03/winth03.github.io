In the post\u2013apocalyptic age, \"human\" is more specifically used to denote those that have been more-or-less unaffected by radiation as opposed to mutants like ghouls and super mutants, even though said mutant types originate from humans. Non\u2013mutated humans are sometimes called normals, smoothskins, humies, or bleeders by their mutant counterparts. Despite the existence of various mutations, humans are still the most common humanoid creatures on Earth. Post-nuclear humans, as a direct result of the radiation and exposition to the Forced Evolutionary Virus and some other biochemical agents released into the environment during and after the Great War, exhibit more diversity, primarily in genetic structure. The aforementioned factors have resulted in an increased rate of mutations in humans, although very few of these result in phenotypic changes. Most of these changes are non-lethal, non-damaging variations in the human DNA that simply increase the gene pool variety. Also, humans with minor mutations, like additional toes, skin lesions due to TDC infection, permanent red eyes, permanent varicose veins, or complete lack of hair are still considered to be humans.\u201d - Excerpt from the \u201cHuman\u201d page written on the Fallout Fandom Wiki.",

Been there, seen that, got the scars.\u201d - Marcus. \u201cSuper mutants are genetically enhanced humans who were created to be superior in every way to a typical human. Originally planned to be super soldiers, the first Super mutants were created by exposure to the Forced Evolutionary Virus II from the vats of the Mariposa Military Base in California. Other strains of Super mutants are found throughout the wasteland created from various sources, often varying in size and intelligence. Regardless of their origin, all Super mutants were created by way of the Forced Evolutionary Virus having mutated from humans. With the creation of the FEV-II strain, scientists were able to create powerful super-soldiers, exhibiting superior physical prowess, resistance to combat damage, aging, and disease, as well as a negligible loss of intelligence and inevitable infertility. People who were turned into mutants via would have their skin turn a shade of green, yellow, or olive with their entire body growing huge with more muscle mass being added by the Virus. But those who were turned into mutants had only fleeting memories of their human lives. They could not breed, as the FEV turned them sterile, thus limiting the generations of mutants. A strain of mutants known as night-kin had their skin change to a gray-purple color after long exposure to stealth boys.\u201d - Excerpt from the \u201cSuper Mutant\u201d page written on the Fallout Fandom Wiki.",
